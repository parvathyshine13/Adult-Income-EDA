# ðŸ§¹ Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering in Machine Learning

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project focuses on core preprocessing and feature engineering techniques to prepare the **Adult Income Dataset** for machine learning modeling. It includes tasks such as handling missing values, scaling, encoding, creating new features, and selecting important features using advanced methods like **Isolation Forest** and **Predictive Power Score (PPS)**.

## ðŸ—ƒ Dataset
The **Adult** dataset predicts whether a person's income exceeds $50K/year based on census data. Key features include:
- Age
- Workclass
- Education
- Marital Status
- Occupation
- Relationship
- Race
- Sex
- Capital Gain/Loss
- Hours per Week
- Native Country
- Income (target)
